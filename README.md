The code implements a machine learning pipeline to predict students' grade classes using a Random Forest classifier.
It begins by loading and preprocessing the dataset, dropping non-informative columns, and splitting the data into features and target variables.
The dataset is further divided into training and testing sets (80/20 split). The model is then trained on the training data, and predictions are made on the test set. 
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision (weighted), and recall (weighted) are calculated to assess the model’s performance.
Additionally, a confusion matrix heatmap is generated to visually display how well the model’s predictions align with the actual outcomes, providing a clear view of the true positives, 
false positives, true negatives, and false negatives across different grade classes.
